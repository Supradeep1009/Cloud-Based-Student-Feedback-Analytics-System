##  About The Project

In most universities, collecting and acting on student feedback is a slow, manual process. Forms get printed, collected, and often never properly analyzed. This project changes that.

Students fill out a simple web form — sharing how they feel about their faculty's teaching style, interaction quality, language of instruction, and overall performance. The moment they hit submit, their response is saved instantly to **Google Cloud Firestore**. From there, the data is automatically pulled into **Google Sheets** and visualized in a live **Power BI dashboard** — giving faculty coordinators a clear, real-time view of how each professor is performing across different subjects.

The goal is simple: **make student voices count, and make faculty improvement measurable.**

>  Built as part of a Cloud Computing project at **KL University (2026)**, this system demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline — from a student clicking "Submit" to a coordinator reading insights on a dashboard.

##  Backend — Google Cloud Firestore

Every student submission is stored as a document inside the `feedbacks` collection in real time.

*(Add your Firestore screenshot as `firestore_preview.png` in the root folder)*

Each document captures:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| `name` | Hussain |
| `rollNumber` | 2300039032 |
| `faculty` | Dr. Nilu Sing |
| `subject` | Data Analytics and Visualization |
| `overallRating` | 4 |
| `interaction` | Frequently |
| `teachingStyle` | Better |
| `language` | English |
| `timestamp` | 28 March 2026 at 16:15 UTC+5:30 |
| `secureRollHash` | *(hashed for student privacy)* |

> 🔒 Roll numbers are hashed before storage — student identity is never exposed in the database.
